    The modified Kepler problem is a Hamiltonian system, i.e., 
    \[
      \mb q' = H_{\mb p}, \quad \mb p' = -H_{\mb q},
    \]
    with the Hamiltonian
    \[
      H(\mb q, \mb p) = \frac{p_1^2 + p_2^2}{2} - \frac1r - \frac{\alpha}{2r^3},
    \]
    where $r = \sqrt{q_1^2 + q_2^2}$, and we take $\alpha = 0.01$. Clearly, $H' = H_{\mb q} \mb q' + H_{\mb p} \mb p' = 0$, so $H(\mb q(t), \mb p(t)) = H(\mb q(0), \mb p(0))$ for all $t$. We consider simulating this system over a long time interval with a relatively coarse, uniform step size $h$, i.e., $bh \gg 1$. The mere accumulation of local errors may then become a problem. For instance, using the explicit midpoint method with $h = 0.1$ and $b = 500$, the approximate solution for $r$ becomes larger than the exact one by two orders of magnitude.
  
    But some methods perform better than would normally be expected. In Figure \ref{F:kepler} we plot $q_1$ vs. $q_2$ (``phase plane portrait'') for (a) the implicit midpoint method using $h = 0.1$, (b) the classical explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 4 using $h = 0.1$, and (c) the exact solution (or rather, a sufficiently close approximation to it). The initial conditions are
    \[
      q_1(0) = 1 - \beta, \quad q_2(0) = 0, \quad p_1(0) = 0, \quad p_2(0) = \sqrt{(1 + \beta)/(1 - \beta)}
    \]
    with $\beta = 0.6$. Clearly, the midpoint solution with this coarse step size outperforms not only the explicit midpoint method but also the fourth-order method. Even though the pointwise error reaches close to 100\% when $t$ is close to $b$, the midpoint solution lies on a torus, like the exact solution, whereas the RK4 (classical fourth-order) picture is noisy. Thus, we see yet again that truncation error is not everything, even in some nonstiff situations, and the theory in this case must include other aspects.
  
    Integrate these equations using the two methods of Figure \ref{F:kepler} with a constant step size $h = 0.1$ and $h = 0.01$ (four runs in total), monitoring the maximum deviation $|H(\mb q(t), \mb p(t)) - H( \mb q(0),\mb p(0))|$. (This is a simple error indicator which typically underestimates the error in the solution components, and is of interest in its own right.) What are your conclusions?

  Figure \ref{F:04_1} shows the results for the implicit midpoint method for $h = 0.1$ and $h = 0.01$. We notice that the phase plane portraits are qualitatively very good and sharp. Also, the energy discrepancy is bounded in each case. For $h = 0.1$, $|H(\mb q(t), \mb p(t)) - H( \mb q(0),\mb p(0))| < 0.05$ and for $h = 0.01$, $|H(\mb q(t), \mb p(t)) - H( \mb q(0),\mb p(0))| < 6 \times 10^{-4}$.

  Figure \ref{F:04_2} shows the results for the classical Runge-Kutta method of order 4. Both of the phase plane diagrams are fuzzier than their implicit midpoint counterparts, especially for $h = 0.1$. What is most striking is the energy discrepancy. The error in the RK4 method ends up being systematic, leading to a long term increase in energy error. Since the energy constraint is violated, it drifts away from the actual solution over time.

  For $h = 0.1$, the energy discrepancy reaches almost $0.15$ at $t = 500$ compared with less than $0.05$ for the implicit midpoint method. It is clear that this is affected greatly by $bh$ being much larger than $1$.
  
  For $h = 0.01$, the Runge-Kutta method performs better. The energy discrepancy is less than $1.4 \times 10^{-6}$ compared with about $6 \times 10^{-4}$ for the implicit midpoint method. However, if we needed to compute to $t_f = 5000$, the implicit midpoint method would again win out.
  
  We conclude from these examples that accuracy is not the only thing we should consider since the second order implicit midpoint method outperforms the fourth order RK method. Instead we should look for a method that works best with the specific problem and all of its properties. In this case the problem was unique because of the conservation of energy property. The symmetries of the implicit midpoint method make it better suited to obey this conservation of energy.
