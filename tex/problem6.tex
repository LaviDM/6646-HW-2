\begin{problem}[A\&P 5.9]
  The following ODE system due to H. Robertson models a chemical reaction system and has been used extensively as a test problem for stiff solvers:
  \begin{align*}
    y_1' &= -\alpha y_1 + \beta y_2 y_3, \\
    y_2' &= \alpha y_1 - \beta y_2 y_3 - \gamma y_2^2, \\
    y_3' &= \gamma y_2^2.
  \end{align*}
  Here $\alpha = 0.04$, $\beta = 1.e + 4$, and $\gamma = 3.e + 7$ are slow, fast, and very fast reaction rates. The starting point is $\mb y(0) = (1,0,0)^T$.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item It is known that this system reaches a steady state, i.e., where $\mb y' = \mb 0$. Show that $\sum_{i=1}^3 y_i(t) = 1,\quad 0 \leq t \leq b$; then find the steady state.
    \item Integrate the system using a nonstiff code with a permissive error tolerance (say $1.e - 2$) for the interval length $b = 3$, just to see how inadequate a nonstiff solver can be. How far is $\mb y(b)$ from the steady state?
    \item The steady state is reached very slowly for this problem. Use a stiff solver to integrate the problem for $b = 1.e + 6$ and plot the solution on a semilog scale in $t$. How far is $\mb y(b)$ from the steady state?
  \end{enumerate}
