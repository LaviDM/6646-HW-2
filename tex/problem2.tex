    The following classical example from astronomy gives a strong motivation to integrate initial value ODEs with error control.
  
    Consider two bodies of masses $\mu = 0.0122771171$ and $\hat{\mu}= 1 - \mu$ (earth and sun) in a planar motion, and a third body of negligible mass (moon) moving in the same plane. The motion is governed by the equations
    \begin{align*}
      u_1'' &= u_1 + 2u_2' - \hat{\mu} \frac{u_1 + \mu}{D_1} - \mu \frac{u_1 - \hat{\mu}}{D_2}, \\
      u_2'' &= u_2 - 2u_1' - \hat{\mu}\frac{u_2}{D_1} - \mu\frac{u_2}{D_2}, \\
      D_1 &= ((u_1 + \mu)^2 + u_2^2)^{3/2}, \\
      D_2 &= ((u_1 - \hat{\mu})^2 + u_2^2)^{3/2}.
    \end{align*}
    Starting with the initial conditions
    \begin{align*}
      u_1(0) &= 0.994, \quad u_2(0) = 0, \quad u_1'(0) = 0, \\
      u_2'(0) &= -2.00158510637908252240537862224,
    \end{align*}
    the solution is periodic with period $< 17.1$. Note that $D_1 = (-\mu, 0)$ and $D_2 = 0$ at $(\hat{\mu},0)$, so we need to be careful when the orbit passes near these singularity points.
  
    The orbit is depicted in Figure \ref{F:orbit}. It was obtained using a 4(5) embedded pair with a local error tolerance $1.e - 6$. This necessitated 204 time steps.
  
    Using the classical Runge-Kutta method of order 4, integrate this problem on $[0,17.1]$ with a \emph{uniform} step size, using 100, 1000, 10,000, and 20,000 steps. Plot the orbit for each case. How many uniform steps are needed before the orbit appears to be \emph{qualitatively} correct?

\begin{solution}
  The classical Runge-Kutta method of order 4 is given by 
  \begin{align*}
    Y_1 &= y_{n-1}, \\
    Y_2 &= y_{n-1} + \frac{h}{2} f(t_{n-1}, Y_1), \\
    Y_3 &= y_{n-1} + \frac{h}{2} f(t_{n-1/2}, Y_2), \\
    Y_4 &= y_{n-1} + h f(t_{n-1/2}, Y_3), \\
    y_n &= y_{n-1} + \frac{h}{6} \left( f(t_{n-1}, Y_1) + 2 f(t_{n-1/2}, Y_2) + 2 f(t_{n-1/2}, Y_3) + f(t_n, Y_4)\right).
  \end{align*}
  We can convert the system to be first-order by writing
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      x_1 \\ x_2 \\ y_1 \\ y_2
    \end{pmatrix}'
    = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      x_2 \\
      x_1 + 2y_2 - \hat{\mu}(x_1 + \mu)((x_1 + \mu)^2 + y_1^2)^{-3/2} - \mu(x_1 - \hat{\mu})((x_1 - \hat{\mu})^2 + y_1^2)^{-3/2} \\
      y_2 \\
      y_1 - 2x_2 - \hat{\mu}y_1((x_1 + \mu)^2 + y_1^2)^{-3/2} - \mu y_1((x_1 - \hat{\mu})^2 + y_1^2)^{-3/2}
    \end{pmatrix}.

  Figure \ref{F:02} shows the results in phase space for using 100, 1000, 10000, and 20000 uniform steps. The orbit becomes qualitatively accurate around 10000 steps. This is a huge number of steps compared to the 204 needed using a method with local error tolerance. Using uniform steps requires that all steps are as small as they need to be around the singularities.
